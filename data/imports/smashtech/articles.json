And one of the best ways we get our diverse team sharing thoughts, experiences and ideas is through our monthly socials. You\u2019ll be surprised at how much you can learn about a person through a game of bag toss!<\/p>\r\n<p>Our teams are always out and about joining conferences, holding team meetings outdoors, or just bouncing around ideas over drinks. So if you happen to see some of us wearing Smash shirts or caps roaming around the downtown area, feel free to say hi and strike a conversation!<\/p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"
